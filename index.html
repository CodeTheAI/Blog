      <p class="bold-text">Introduction to IT Basics</p>
          <ul>
            <p class="bold-text">1. Hardware</p>
            <b>Hardware</b> refers to the physical components of a computer system. Key hardware components include:
            <pre></pre>
            <li><b>Central Processing Unit (CPU): The brain of the computer that performs instructions defined by software.</b></li>
            <li><b>Memory (RAM): Temporary storage that the CPU uses to store data that is being processed.</b></li>
            <li><b>Devices: Includes hard drives (HDD), solid-state drives (SSD), and external storage devices used to store data permanently.</b></li>
            <li><b>Input Devices: Keyboards, mice, scanners, and other devices used to input data into a computer.</b></li>
            <li><b>Output Devices: Monitors, printers, and speakers that output data from a computer.</b></li>
            <p class="bold-text">2. Software</p>
            <b>Software</b> is a set of instructions that tells the hardware what to do. It can be categorized into:
            <pre></pre>
            <li><b>System Software: Includes operating systems (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux) that manage hardware and software resources.</b></li>
            <li><b>Application Software: Programs designed to perform specific tasks for users, such as word processors, web browsers, and games.</b></li>
            <li><b>Utility Software: Tools that help maintain, analyze, and optimize a computer, such as antivirus programs and disk cleanup tools.</b></li>
            <p class="bold-text">3. Networking</p>
            <b>Networking</b> involves connecting multiple computers and devices to share resources and information. Key concepts include:
            <pre></pre>
            <li><b>Local Area Network (LAN): A network that connects devices within a limited area, such as an office or home.</b></li>
            <li><b>Wide Area Network (WAN): A network that covers a large geographic area, connecting multiple LANs. The internet is the largest WAN.</b></li>
            <li><b>Protocols: Rules that govern data transmission over a network. Common protocols include TCP/IP, HTTP, and FTP.</b></li>
            <li><b>Routers and Switches: Devices that direct data traffic within and between networks.</b></li>
            <li><b>IP Address: A unique identifier assigned to each device on a network, enabling communication between devices.</b></li>
            <p class="bold-text">4. Role of IT in Modern Organizations</p>
            <b>Information Technology (IT)</b> plays a crucial role in modern organizations by:
            <pre></pre>
            <li><b>Enhancing Communication: Email, instant messaging, and video conferencing tools facilitate efficient communication.</b></li>
            <li><b>Improving Efficiency: Automation of routine tasks and access to real-time data improve productivity and decision-making.</b></li>
            <li><b>Supporting Innovation: IT enables the development of new products and services, driving business growth.</b></li>
            <li><b>Ensuring Security: IT departments implement security measures to protect data and systems from cyber threats.</b></li>
            <li><b>Managing Data: IT systems store, process, and analyze large volumes of data, providing valuable insights for strategic planning.</b></li>
